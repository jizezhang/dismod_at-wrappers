Demos on how to use the wrapper code as well as utility functions. Data files are
not included because of size limits.

* `match_covariate`: demo of using `covariate.py` to match covariate to measurement
* `prevalence_fixed_only`: demo of fitting a fixed-only model on indirect measurement data
* `Sincidence_fixed_only`: demo of fitting a fixed-only model on direct measurement data
* `Sincidence_cov_fixed_only`: demo of fitting a fixed-only model with covariates

`Sincidence_fixed_only` and `Sincidence_cov_fixed_only` have sample plots.
